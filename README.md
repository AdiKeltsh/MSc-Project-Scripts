# MSc-Project-Scripts
The following scripts were developed for my MSc research project. The project explored the differences between stereo and binaural audio for video games (non-VR). A virtual testing environment was develop within unity to fit the aims and objectives of my project. The scripts uploaded here were used for the Binaural version of the virtual testing environment. Please refer to the comments within the script for further information.

These scripts were made to be used within Unity 2018.1.f1, with FMOD 2.0 being used as the audio engine.
